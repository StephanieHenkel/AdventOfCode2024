# ✨ Advent of Code 2024 ✨

Welcome to my repository for **Advent of Code 2024**! 
This is where I'll document my journey solving the daily 
coding challenges of this year's Advent of Code. 🎄✨

## About Advent of Code

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an annual set of programming challenges that are released daily during December. It's a great way to:

- Sharpen your programming skills 🧑‍💻
- Solve fun and creative puzzles 🎁
- Compete (or collaborate!) with a global community 🌍

Each day features a new challenge, with increasing complexity as the event progresses.
